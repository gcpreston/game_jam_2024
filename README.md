# Game Jam 2024

Current state:
- Trying to make a grid following [this guide](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/2d/tactical-rpg-movement/lessons/01.grid/), but it doesn't work for some reason (`Invalid call. Nonexistent function 'calculate_grid_coordinates' in base 'Nil'.`)

For tomorrow:
- Start progressing on minigames
